# Collatz Conjecture

In this program, I used the for loop in order to simulate the Collatz Conjecture. The Collatz conjecture is when you take an odd number and mutiply it by three, then add one. With an even number, you would divide it by 2. With each new number, you keep doing this until you get to 1. For example, 10 is divided by 2 since it is even, then you get 5. After that you multiply it by 3 and add one which makes 16, since 5 is an odd number. Then you divide 16 by 2 since it is an even number. Then it becomes 8, which is divided by 2, then 4, then 2 and finally 1. I was fascinated by the Collatz Conjecture and decided to try it myself with a C++ app. Now you can try it yourself with this app.
